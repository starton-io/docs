# Storing your first file on IPFS

You can use Starton to integrate blockchain into your application in a few steps. Let's upload a file from Code with Starton's API.

:::info not a developer?
To follow this tutorial, you will need **coding experience**. If it's not your case, you can still upload your files:

<div className="row-is-multilineGS">
	<div className="col col-2 cardsGS">
		<Link className="button-card button-card--vertical" to="https://app.starton.com/projects/default/ipfs">
			<Heading as={"h4"}>From Starton app</Heading>
			<div className="button-card__inner">
				<p color="white">An easy-to-use interface to upload files to IPFS.</p>
			</div>

	</div>
</div>

:::

## Step 1 - Initialize the project

1. Start by creating a directory for your project.

    ```bash
    mkdir upload-ipfs
    ```

2. Then, get into your project directory.

    ```bash
    cd upload-ipfs
    ```

3. With your project directory set up, install the dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm add axios form-data
    ```

    - [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) allows you to make request to the Starton API.
    - [form-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-data) facilitates the creation and submission of form data using HTTP requests.

4. Then, use`touch` to create a `index.js` file and open it with your favorite editor.

    ```bash
    touch list.js
    ```

## Step 2 - Add starton to your project

1. First, import `axios`.

    ```jsx showLineNumbers
    const axios = require("axios")
    ```

2. Then, initialize `axios` using Starton URL and authenticate with your API KEY.

<CardTitle icon={<Starton fill="primary" />} href="https://app.starton.com/projects/default/developer" target="_blank">
	Create an API key
</CardTitle>
<br />

```jsx showLineNumbers
const starton = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "YOUR API KEY",
	},
})
```

## Step 3 - Upload a file to IPFS

:::caution Watch your uploads
Files on IPFS are immutable and can be widely replicated. Once uploaded, anyone can access your file and removal is almost impossible challenging. Think twice before sharing!
:::

1. Grab any file from your computer. You can also generate an image using [generative AI](/tutorials/ai-nft-collection).

    ```jsx showLineNumbers
    const fs = require("fs")
    const FormData = require("form-data")
    const buffer = fs.readFileSync("./path/of/your/file.png")
    ```

2. Prepare the file for the request.

    ```jsx showLineNumbers
    let data = new FormData()
    data.append("file", buffer, "name of your file")
    ```

3. Send the file to IPFS.

    ```jsx showLineNumbers
    starton
    	.post("/v3/ipfs/file", data, {
    		headers: {
    			"Content-type": `multipart/form-data; boundary=${data.getBoundary()}`,
    		},
    	})
    	.then((response) => {
    		console.log({
    			cid: response.data.cid,
    			gatewayUrl: `https://eu.starton-ipfs.com/ipfs/${response.data.cid}`,
    		})
    	})
    	.catch((error) => console.error(error.response.data))
    ```

    You can also upload [folders](/docs/ipfs/uploading-folder), [JSON files](/docs/ipfs/uploading-json) or [pin existing files using their CID](/docs/ipfs/pinning-file).

4. Almost done! Now we can execute it to get your first file stored on IPFS!

    ```bash
    node list.js
    ```

    And just like that, your first file is now stored on IPFS!
