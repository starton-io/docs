# Granting access to a specific wallet to Starton Identity and Access Management

In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect an **AWS Key Management System (KMS)** to **Starton**.

:::note
 **Starton** provides test wallets hosted on our **Key Management System**, but when going in production, to maintain control over your wallets, you should use your own KMS.

:::

To connect **Starton** to your **AWS KMS**, you can grant access to **Starton** only to one wallet of your **KMS**. You can also [grant full access to **Starton** on your **KMS**](/docs/wallet/grantfull-access).

:::info
By granting access to **Starton** only to one wallet, youâ€™ll have to create new wallets and import them every time on your own.
