# How to test webhooks locally with ngrok

When Starton sends a notification, Monitor sends an HTTP request to a web server.
If your server is actually localhost, the request will fail. Starton cannot actually reach localhost.
We need a tool to make that possible. The tool we're using is called ngrok.

## Installing ngrok

1. Go to [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
1. Install ngrok on your system. 

# Launching your ngrok URL

1. Launch your web application.
1. Go to your localhost port. For example, [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
1. Launch `ngrok` with the command `ngrok http 3001`.
1. Go to your Ngrok Web Interface [http://127.0.0.1:4040](http://127.0.0.1:4040).
1. Click the `Status` tab.
1. Copy the URL of the tunnel which should look like this [https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io](https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok.io).

# Creating your watcher in Starton

You can use this Webhook URL in Starton to create your watcher.

To create a watcher from the code of you application, use the following snippet.
You can find the full list of networks and event types in our <a href="https://docs.starton.com//intro#tag/Watcher/operation/WatcherCreateOne">API reference</a>.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" showLineNumbers>
{`const axios = require("axios");
// First, authenticate to the API
const startonApi = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});
// Use the watcher creation endpoint
startonApi.post(
    "/v3/watcher",
    {
        name: "Name of your watcher", // Enter a name for your watcher
        description: "Describe your watcher", // Enter a description for your watcher
        address: "0x000000000000", // Enter the address to watch (either a wallet or a smart contract)
        network: "polygon-mumbai",// Enter the network of your address.
        type: "ADDRESS_ACTIVITY",// Select an event type
        webhookUrl: "https://xxxxxxx/", // Here, enter the webhook url you got from ngrok.
        confirmationsBlocks: 50 // Depending on your needs, select the number of confirmed blocks before an event triggers your watcher
    }
).then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data)
})`}
