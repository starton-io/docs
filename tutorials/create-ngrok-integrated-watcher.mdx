<StepSection stepTitle={1}>
## Creating Your Node.js Project

Set up your Node.js project environment:

1. **Create a Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-starton-project
    cd my-starton-project
    ```

2. **Initialize Your Node.js Project**:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3. **Install Essential Packages**:

    ```bash
    npm install express dotenv axios body-parser ngrok node-notifier
    ```

    - **`express`**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building APIs and web servers.
    - **`dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a **`.env`** file into **`process.env`**, managing configuration settings separately from the code.
    - **`axios`**: A promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous HTTP requests to external resources, like REST APIs.
    - **`body-parser`**: Middleware for Express that parses incoming request bodies, making them available under the **`req.body`** property.
    - **`ngrok`**: Exposes local development servers to the Internet, useful for testing applications that interact with external services like webhooks.
    - **`node-notifier`**: A module for sending native desktop notifications, providing visual feedback from scripts or applications.



### **Understanding Webhooks**

Webhooks dispatch automated HTTP POST requests activated by specific events in a source system. They relay data to a recipient system. With Starton, watchers utilize webhooks to send event notifications.

<StepSection stepTitle={2}>
### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. **Configuring Variables**:
   Create or update the `.env` file in your project's root directory:

```
STARTON_API_KEY=YOUR_STARTON_API_KEY
NGROK_TOKEN=YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
```

2. **Retrieving Your Ngrok Authentication Token**

1. **Sign Up or Log In**: Visit [Ngrok's website](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up or log in.
2. **Find the Token**: In the dashboard, go to Your Authtoken and click Copy.

## Configuring the Watcher Integration

In your project's root directory, create a file named `index.js` and insert the following code:
Tailor the watcher parameters and the rest of the code to suit your project's needs.

```jsx
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const notifier = require('node-notifier');
const ngrok = require('ngrok');
const axios = require("axios");
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
    baseURL: "<https://api.starton.com>",
    headers: {
        "x-api-key": process.env.STARTON_API_KEY,
    },
});
let watcherId = null;

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
        if (req.body.data) {
            notifier.notify({
                title: 'New transaction',
                message: `Hash: ${req.body.data.transaction.hash}`
            })
        }
        res.send('ok')
    })
const port = 30001
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`)
    createNgrokTunnelAndWatcher()
})

const createNgrokTunnelAndWatcher = async () => {
    const url = await ngrok.connect({
        authtoken: process.env.NGROK_TOKEN,
        addr: port
    })
	  console.log(`NGROK listening on ${url}`)
    axiosInstance.post("/v3/watcher", {
        name: "Watcher test",
        address: "0x7ceB23fD6bC0adD59E62ac25578270cFf1b9f619",
        network: "polygon-mainnet",
        type: "EVENT_TRANSFER",
        webhookUrl: url,
        confirmationsBlocks: 0
    }).then((response) => {
        console.log("Watcher created", response.data)
        watcherId = response.data.id
    }).catch(e => console.log(e.response.data))
}

```

Tailor the watcher parameters to your needs like so :

| name: "Watcher test", | name of your watcher in Starton (learn more) |
| --- | --- |
| address:"0x7ceB23fD6bC0adD59E62ac25578270cFf1b9f619", | address watched on the blockchain (learn more) |
| network: "polygon-mainnet", | network on which we are creating the watcher (learn more) |
| type: "EVENT_TRANSFER", | Type of event returned by the watcher (learn more) |
| webhookUrl: url, | Url of your webhook (learn more) |
| confirmationsBlocks: 0 | Number of confirmation blocks (learn more) |

## Automating the deletion of our test watcher

After testing, ensure to delete the watcher to prevent unintended operations.

```jsx
const deleteWatcher = async () => {
    await axiosInstance.delete(`/v3/watcher/${watcherId}`).then(response => {
        console.log("Watcher deleted")
    })
    process.exit();
}
   
process.on('SIGINT', deleteWatcher)
process.on('SIGTERM', deleteWatcher)
```

##Running the Project**

1. **Server**:
   Start your server using the command:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    
    ```

2. **Client**:
   Access your application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.

</StepSection>

<StepSection stepTitle={6}>
 Setting Up Webhooks with Ngrok**

1. **Launching Ngrok**:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    
    ```

   Document the provided URL for webhook testing.

2. **Webhook Examination**:
   Use the Ngrok URL as the webhook endpoint when creating the watcher.

</StepSection>

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated Starton's Monitor with webhook notifications using Ngrok. This setup allows you to monitor blockchain activities locally and in real-time. As you transition to a production environment, remember to use permanent and secure webhook endpoints.
