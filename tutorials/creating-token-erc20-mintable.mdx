# How to create your own cryptocurrency (ERC20)

In this tutorial, we will create your own token. The mintable supply version of this standard guarantees no token will ever be created after the initial emission.
Fungible tokens are token from which the value of each token is equal to another.

:::note You will need:

-   **a wallet address with funds:** You can use your default Starton wallet, at creation Starton provides you with faucets.
-   **definitiveName:** The name of your smart contract which will be reflected on-chain.
-   **definitiveSymbol:** The symbol of your smart contract which will be reflected on-chain
-   **initialSupply:** The initial amount of tokens that will be minted.
-   **initialOwnerOrMultisigContract:** The address that will own the ERC20 contract.

:::

**In this tutorial, we will:**

-   [Deploy the smart contract template for your token](#deploying-the-smart-contract)
-   [Process your first token transfer](#minting-the-first-nft-of-your-collection)

## Deploying the Smart contract from our template
