## Deploy an ERC1155 Auction Sale smart contract

You can start by accessing the list of templates in the [Smart contract section](/docs/smart-contract/understanding-smart-contracts). Then, you can deploy the smart contract from code.

```js showLineNumbers
const axios = require("axios")

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "PUT HERE YOUR API KEY",
	},
})

axiosInstance
	.post("/v3/smart-contract/from-template", {
		network: "",
		signerWallet: "",
		templateId: "ERC1155_AUCTION_SALE",
		name: "",
		description: "",
		params: [
			"", //definitiveTokenAddress
			"", //definitiveFeeReceiver
			"", //initialStartingPrice
			"", //initialMinPriceDifference
			"", //initialStartTime
			"", //initialEndTime
			"", //initialTokenID
			"", //initialTokenAmount
		],
	})
	.then((response) => {
		console.log(response.data)
	})
```

1. Select the ERC1155 Auction template.
1. Enter:

-   **definitiveTokenAddress**: The token address of the ERC1155 that you want to sell.
-   **definitiveFeeReceiver**: The address that will receive all the price paid to mint the NFTs.
-   **initialStartingPrice**: The initial price that the NFT will be sold for.
-   **initialMinPriceDifference**: The price increase that a user needs to at least put to bid on top of the current auction winner.
-   **initialStartTime**: The time when the sale will begin and users can bid.
-   **initialEndTime**: The time when the sale will end and users couldn't bid anymore.
-   **initialTokenURI**: The URI that will be append in the end of the base token URI for the token that will be minted.
-   **initialTokenID**: The token id of the token that will be minted for the auction.
-   **initialTokenAmount**: The amount of tokens that will be minted for the auction.

## Giving ownership to your sale contract

For the sale contract to be able to mint new tokens, you are going to need to grant the newly created contract the MINTER_ROLE over the base contract deployed.

You will need:

-   the address of the base ERC1155 contract
-   the address of the Sale contract
-   the data of the Minter Role (in bytes)

### Retrieving the MINTER_ROLE

First, let's get the minter role:

```js showLineNumbers
const axios = require("axios")

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "PUT HERE YOUR API KEY",
	},
})

axiosInstance
	.post("/v3/smart-contract/{network}/{YOUR_BASE_CONTRACT}/read", {
		functionName: "MINTER_ROLE",
		params: [],
	})
	.then((response) => {
		console.log(response.data)
	})
```

### Granting the minter role to your Sale contract

To grant the minter role to your contract, you can use the following request:

```js
const axios = require("axios")

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: { "x-api-key": "PUT HERE YOUR API KEY" },
})

axiosInstance
	.post("/v3/smart-contract/${network}/${YOUR SMART CONTRAT ADDRESS}/call", {
		functionName: "grantRole(bytes32,address)",
		params: [
			"0x9f2df0fed2c77648de5860a4cc508cd0818c85b8b8a1ab4ceeef8d981c8956a6", // MINTER_ROLE
			"", // account
		],
		signerWallet: "",
		speed: "average",
	})
	.then((response) => {
		console.log(response.data)
	})
```

-   account: The whitelist sale contract address

## Interact with your contract

You can now bid, claim, or start a new auction. The mint of your NFT is made when the bider which has won the auction claims it.
