>**What is DALL-E 2?**
>
>DALL-E 2 is an artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by OpenAI. DALL-E 2 is designed to generate images from textual descriptions.
>
>It is capable of generating complex and detailed images. It can create images that are up to 1024x1024 pixels in size, and can generate multiple objects and textures within a single image. DALL-E 2 can also create images that are animated and can be interacted with.

## INSTALLING THE PROJECT

:::info

The project has been set up using a client-side and a server-side so that your API key is not exposed on client. You can also use the server-side to connect a database for metrics.

:::

### **CREATING STARTON PROJECT**

1. Clone the project from [Starton AI generative NFT collection GitHub](https://github.com/starton-io/AI-generated-NFT-collection).

### SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Before you start setting up the project, you need to set the environment variables.

1. In the `backend` folder of the project, set up an **`.env`** according to `.env.example`:

```ini
API_HOST=localhost
API_PORT=8000

## Put on the following line your Starton API key (available at https://app.starton.com)
STARTON_API_URL='https://api.starton.io/v3'
STARTON_API_KEY=

## Put on the following line your Signer wallet address
STARTON_SIGNER_WALLET=

## Put on the following line your OpenAI API key (available at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=
```
1. In the `frontend` set up your `.env` file according to `.env.example` :
```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACK_URL=http://localhost:8000
````

### SETTING UP THE SERVER SIDE

Here we would like to enter the data needed to generate and deploy your collection as well as entering your API, so that you can authenticate safely to the API.

1. Go to the **`backend`** folder of the project.
2. Run the command **`yarn install`** to install the required dependencies.
3. Start the server by running the command **`yarn dev`**.

### SETTING UP OUR CLIENT SIDE

On the client side, we will set up all the information of your smart contract to connect your project to Web3Auth.

1. Go to the **`frontend`** folder of the project.
2. Run the command **`yarn install`** to install the required dependencies.

## RUNNING THE PROJECT

To run your project, you will need to run commands both on server and client side.

1. In `server`, run the command `yarn dev`
2. In `client`, run the command `yarn dev`

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to test your project.

## GENERATING AND DEPLOYING YOUR COLLECTION

Once started, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to enter the following parameters:
1. Enter the **receiver wallet** of the NFT (where you want to send the NFTs).
2. Select the **network** on which you want to deploy your NFTs.
   If you are testing, then use the testnet network, and if you are ready to deploy, use the mainnet network (between Polygon, Avalanche, Binance, and Ethereum).
3. Choose the **number of NFTs** that you want to create for your collection.
4. Enter the prompt that will generate the images for your NFTs.
   You can use different prompts to create unique and personalised NFTs.
5. Click **Generate** to display the assets for your NFTs.
6. Review the generated assets.
7. Once you are satisfied with the images, click **Deploy**.

Congratulations! You just deployed an NFT collection of images generated by AI.
