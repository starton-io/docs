## Starton Services

**Starton** regroups multiple services that offer **different ways to integrate blockchain technology** to your product:

-   **[Smart contracts](/docs/smart-contract/understanding-smart-contracts)** consists of:
    -   **[Library](/docs/smart-contract/deploying-a-smart-contract)**: a collection of **ready-to-use audited smart contracts** so you don't need to code your own.
    -   **[Deploy](/docs/smart-contract/deploying-from-bytecode)**: a service to **deploy smart contracts on the network of your choice**. You can also **import an already deployed smart contract**.
    -   **[Interact](/docs/smart-contract/interacting-with-a-smart-contract)**: a service to **interact a deployed smart contract**. No need to code your integration or use any provider.
-   **[Relayer](/docs/transactions/understanding-the-relayer)** is an API to **create transactions, deploy or interact with your smart contracts**. It is the underlying API on which are based **Deploy** and **Interact**. **Starton** handles **transactions and providers**, deals with **nonce issues, keys management, and monitors blockchains**.
-   **[Monitor](/docs/watcher/understanding-watchers)** empowers your application by **creating watchers returning specific events** happening on a chosen blockchain.
    When conditions are met, watchers will then notify you through webhooks.
-   **[Storage](/docs/ipfs/understanding-ipfs)** is **Starton's pinning service** that makes **IPFS - the InterPlanetary FileSystem -** accessible to anyone.
    With this service, we can **host your files, folders and jsons** on our IPFS nodes so they stay available at any time.
