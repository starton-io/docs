At the top-right hand of the page, click **\<\<** to display the Developer mode.

## Code

You can use Starton from code with Javascript. The parameters entered on the interface form are edited in real-time on the Dev mode.

:::info

Dev mode is not useful on every view of the interface. Dev mode will resume when a request is performed that you can integrate to your code.
