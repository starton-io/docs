# Interacting with Smart Contracts

Once a smart contract has been deployed or imported, you can interact with it using our **Dashboard** or from Code using the Relayer.

The possible interactions are:

-   Calling a function of the smart contract (will require gas on the associated blockchain's network).
-   Reading the information on the smart contract (usually free of gas), such as reading the balance on an ERC20 contract.

To interact with a smart contract, you can first list all the functions of your smart contracts using:

```jsx showLineNumbers
const axios = require("axios")

const startonAPI = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
	},
})

startonAPI
	.get("/v3/smart-contract/polygon-mumbai/0xF205506dA3aF8D0Cc0f90D7C0c0eA4EFA6423CFF/available-functions")
	.then((res) => console.log(res.data))
	.catch((e) => console.log(e))
```

Then, once you have the right function, you can call it. For example, here, we're trying to mint 1000 new tokens.

```jsx showLineNumbers
const axios = require("axios")

const startonAPI = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
	},
})

startonAPI
	.post("/v3/smart-contract/polygon-mumbai/0x608B2BC89f569Bf883A6d0A36aDBd8DC937fAf2e/call", {
		signerWallet: "0x694F07CEEc0869aa0dB5E8157FA538268F28B23f",
		functionName: "mint(address,uint256)",
		params: ["0x694F07CEEc0869aa0dB5E8157FA538268F28B23f", "10000000000000"],
	})
	.then((res) => console.log(res.data))
	.catch((e) => console.log(e))
```

As the number will be read in Gwei, you need to add 18 zeros after the amount of token you want to mint.

You can check your transaction using the transaction hash on your selected network.

## Smart contract functions

Read [Smart Contracts references](/docs/smart-contract/parameters-and-functions) for more information on how to call smart contract functions.
