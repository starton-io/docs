# Importing a smart contract already deployed on the blockchain

You can import on **Starton** smart contracts that are already deployed on the blockchain.
To do so, you will need:

-   the address and network of the contract
-   the ABI of the contract

Be sure to replace `x-api-key value` with your own API key!
