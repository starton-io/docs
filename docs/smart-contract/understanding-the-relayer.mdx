# Understanding the transaction manager

The **Relayer** is a blockchain transaction management solution to create transactions, deploy and interact with smart contracts on the behalf of a user.

As the underlying API on which are based the **Deploy** and **Interact** services, it enables developers to interact with blockchain from a simple request.

You can:

-   make a standard transaction (sending funds to someone)
-   call a smart contractâ€™s function from the back-end
-   deploy a new smart contract on supported blockchains networks

To resume, the **Relayer** acts as an API layer above blockchain protocols for smoother interactions.

**Relayer** is a service enabling centralised servers to interact with the blockchain. It can be used for example, when users want to pay the gas fees of their clients.

## The scope of the Relayer

Pre-chain, the Relayer:

-   **Checks transaction**: The Relayer verifies that the transaction format is valid.
-   Estimates **gas price**: The Relayer checks with blockchain providers and estimates how much the user will pay per unit of gas as a fee.
-   Estimates **gas limit**
-   Sets a nonce to indicate the order of transactions:
-   Sign with a KMS (AWS)

Then, the **Relayer** monitors the transaction:

-   checks mempool
-   checks nonce
-   checks gas price

See API, for more information on endpoints.
