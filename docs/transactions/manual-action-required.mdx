# Troubleshooting blocked transactions

When a transaction is blocked, you need to perform a manual action to resume processing.

## Could not increase gas price

The message "Could not increase gas price" is displayed when the settings for gas price on your transaction were too low to process your transactions.
Starton Relayer, our transaction's engine, was unable to increase the gas price. To solve this issue you can either:

-   Wait. If the gas price to process transaction is too high right now, you can wait for it to decrease.
-   Increase the maximum gas price parameter on API enabling Starton to unlock transactions.
-   Use the API to replace a transaction by another if you changed your mind and want to cancel the transfer.

## Could not unstuck nonce

Your transaction is stuck because another transaction with a lower nonce is missing. We tried to create it for you, but we could not.
To solve this issue:

-   You can send a new unrelated transaction to replace the stuck transaction.
-   In settings, you can use API to authorize Starton to unstuck the nonce.

## Maximum gas price reached

The maximum gas price set in the project was reached (+-15%). Starton Relayer, our transaction's engine, was unable to increase the gas price. To solve this issue you can either:

-   Wait. If the gas price to process transaction is too high right now, you can wait for it to decrease.
-   Increase the maximum gas price parameter on API enabling Starton to unlock transactions.
-   Use the API to replace a transaction by another if you changed your mind and want to cancel the transfer.

## Insufficient funds after broadcast

Your transaction was broadcasted successfully but is now stuck because your funds are insufficient. You need to add funds to your wallet to process this and all the following transactions.
To solve this issue, you can:

-   Add funds to your wallet.
-   If the transaction is too costly, cancel the transaction by replacing it with an empty transaction.
