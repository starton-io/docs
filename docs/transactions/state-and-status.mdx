# Transaction state and status

From **Dashboard**, click **Transactions** to access your transactions activity list.

In **State**, information is displayed to enable you to understand your transaction's workflow.

## State

A transaction can return one of the four following states.

| State   | Log                    | Description                                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Success | SUCCESS                | Transaction is successful. No action required.                           |
| Pending | PENDING                | Transaction is in progress. No action required.                          |
| Blocked | MANUAL_ACTION_REQUIRED | Transaction cannot be processed. Manual action is required on your part. |
| Error   | ERROR                  | An error occurred on the transaction. See below for more information.    |

## Status

Within each state, a status provides you information on the reason for the state.

### Success statuses

### Blocked statuses

:::caution

Transactions in a blocked status require a manual action on your part. Check [Blocked transactions troubleshooting](/docs/transactions/manual-action-required) for more information.

| Status                             | Message                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COULD_NOT_INCREASE_GAS_PRICE       | Could not increase gas price. Your relayer gas price settings do not allow us to increase it more.                                                                                           |
| COULD_NOT_INCREASE_NONCE           | Your transaction is stuck because another transaction with a lower nonce is missing. We tried to create it for you, but we could not.                                                        |
| MAX_GAS_PRICE_REACH                | Could not increase the gas, maximum gas price set in project was reached (+-15%).                                                                                                            |
| INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_AFTER_BROADCAST | Your transaction was broadcasted successfully but is now stuck because your funds are insufficient. You need to add funds to your wallet to process this and all the following transactions. |

### Error statuses

| Status                            | Message                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS                | Your funds are insufficient.                                                                                                                                                         |
| COULD_NOT_ESTIMATE_GAS_PRICE      | Could not estimate gas price. If this issue persists, you can set a custom gas price.                                                                                                |
| INVALID_GAS_PRICE                 | You must set a valid customGas. (For example, For example, on a prior-EIP1559 chain, you can't set maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas.)                                           |
| REPLACEMENT_GAS_PRICE_UNDERPRICED | The gas price is insufficient to replace this transaction. You must increase its gas price by at least 10%.                                                                          |
| COULD_NOT_ESTIMATE_GAS_LIMIT      | Could not estimate gas limit. If this issue persists, you can set a custom gas limit (not recommended).                                                                              |
| EXECUTION_WILL_FAIL               | Your transaction failed when we estimated the gas limit. It means that in the current state of the blockchain, your transaction is invalid and will be reverted if you broadcast it. |
| INVALID_ARGUMENT                  | Some arguments in the parameters object are invalid. Check the required parameters in your ABI.                                                                                      |
| COULD_NOT_ASSIGN_NONCE            | Could not assign nonce. If this issue persists, you can set a specific nonce.                                                                                                        |
| NONCE_EXPIRED                     | You try to send a transaction with a nonce already used.                                                                                                                             |
| COULD_NOT_SIGN                    | Could not sign your transaction. If the issue persists and if you imported your KMS, check the permissions given to Starton.                                                         |
| COULD_NOT_BROADCAST               | Could not broadcast your transaction because of an unknown error. Please contact us or retry later.                                                                                  |
