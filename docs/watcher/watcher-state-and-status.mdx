# Troubleshooting Watchers

From **Dashboard**, click **Monitor** to access your list of watchers.

In the **State** column, information is displayed to help you understand what's happening to your watcher.

## States

A watcher can either be **Running** or **Paused**.

When **Paused**, a status enables you to understand how to solve the issue.
