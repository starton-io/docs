# Blockchain Network Monitor

**Monitor** inspects every block on all supported blockchains to continuously check for activity.
When the conditions of a watcher are met, the watcher triggers and create a webhook and send to the server url provided during the watcher's creation.

**Monitor** takes care of handling forks and block confirmations, ensuring data integrity and consistency in your blockchain operations. Additionally, **Monitor** is built to address scalability issues, providing robust solutions that adapt to varying network demands.
