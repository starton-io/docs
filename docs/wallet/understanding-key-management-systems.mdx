# Connect a key management system

To securely sign transactions without revealing private keys, you need a backend wallet. Starton uses Key Management Systems (KMS). This cloud-based ledger prevents permanent wallet corruption, even if hacked. Forget having to stock your keys in a .env file, use keys directly into your call.

:::info
**Starton** provides test wallets hosted on our **Key Management System**, but when going in production, to maintain control over your wallets, you should use your own KMS. To create a wallet on Starton KMS use the **/kms/wallet** endpoint and enter for **"kmsId"** the value  **"kms_33333333333333333333333333333333‚Äù**.
