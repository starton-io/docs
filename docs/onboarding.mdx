# Authenticating to Starton API

By creating a free account on Starton, you can deploy and interact with your Smart contract, store files on IPFS and watch your transactions.
There are a few things you need to get from Starton Dashboard, regardless of whether you want to use Starton from the interface or the API.

The first thing we will need is an account in Starton.

## Creating an account

</CardTitle>

## Setting up your API key



To use Starton from your backend, you will need to authenticate yourself to the API through an API key.

### What is an API Key?

An API key (Application Programming Key) is used to authenticate yourself to an API.
For example, Starton can generate API keys related to the use of Connect, so you can call our API from your code and authenticate yourself with it.
The API keys generated by Starton are linked to a specific project, which means you could have multiple API keys.

:::caution

Note that your API key should be SECRET. With it, anyone could call the Starton API on your behalf. For security purposes, API keys are only accessible once at creation.

### Generating an API Key

On the **Developer** section, you can generate new API keys or revoke the previous ones (for example, if they leaked).

Create an API key
</CardTitle>

### Using an API Key

The API key will be needed in your code if you try to call Connect's API endpoints (as the x-api-key variable in the Headers of the requests).

```js showLineNumbers
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
	baseURL: "https://api.starton.com",
	headers: {
		"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
	},
})
```

## Understanding Starton Rate limits

A rate limit is a restriction that an API places on the number of times a user or client can access the server within a certain time period. Depending on your plan, you will benefit from a specific rate limit.

| Plan      | Rate limit               |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| Free      | 50 requests/min          |
| Developer | 100 requests/min         |
| Business  | up to 10000 requests/min |
